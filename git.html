    <h3> Notes on git</h3>
    <p>  When adding files use the period- git.  to add all files </p>
    <p>  You can add all of a certain type file by using the star * <br> for example maybe we have a lot of files and 3 .txt files and we want to just add those, use: <br>
    git add '*.txt' </p>
    <p> When you commit something to git you can include a message with -m""<br>
    git commit -m" message descriptive of this commit"</p>
    <p> git log  will show you a history of your actions</p>
    <p> git diff HEAD will show you whats different from your last commit( after you pull it)</p>
    <p> remove staged(ready for push) files with git reset filefolder/filename.txt</p>
    <p> Files can be changed back to how they were at the last commit by using  <br>
    git checkout nameoffileyouwanttochangebackfromthelastcommit.txt</p>s

    <p> A branch is a copy, so you can make seperate commits<br>
    git branch BranchNameHere</p>
    <p> git branch will show you a list of your branches</p>
    <p> you can changes branches by using git checkout NameofBranch </p>
    <p> git rm can be used to remove files ... git rm '*.txt' will remove all txt files.</p>
    <p> Use git merge to merge a branch into another, so checkout to the master and use git merge otherBranchName </p>
    <p> Use git branch -d BranchName to delete a branch</p>

    <p> so when were creating a repo, we add it to remote(github), you name this first remote origin.  followed by the http://,,,,,<br>
    So.,,,   git remote add origin https://blahblah.com</p>
    <p> the first time you push to the origin use:<br>
    git push -u origin master<br>
    The -u tells git to remember the parameters, so next time you can just type git push</p>
